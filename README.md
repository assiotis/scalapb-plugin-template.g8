# Giter8 template for ScalaPB plugins

Do you want to write your own proto code generator in Scala? Do you
want to (optionally) integreate it with ScalaPB? You have found the g8 template
that will you do exactly that!

To get started, type

```
sbt new scalapb/scalapb-plugin-template.g8
```

And provide answers to the parameters you are asked. Note that the project
name can be anything. `organization` would become the maven groupId for this
project, while `package` (which defaults to `organization`) controls the
desired Scala package name.

Once the project is generated, you will find additional usage instructions in
its top-level README.md file.
